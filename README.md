Image Data Processing: RGB to Grayscale Conversion
Project Overview

This Python script efficiently converts RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images into grayscale images. By reducing the color channels from three to one, it significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, making it ideal for various image processing tasks.

**How it Works**

Image Loading: The script loads an RGB image file.
Grayscale Conversion: It applies a weighted average formula to convert each RGB pixel into a single grayscale pixel. This formula typically assigns equal weights to the red, green, and blue channels.
Image Saving: The resulting grayscale image is saved to a specified file path.
